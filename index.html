            <h2>Why Blood Donation Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Blood donation is crucial to save lives and meet the medical needs of patients requiring surgeries, cancer treatments, or trauma care. Donating just one pint of blood can save up to three lives. Blood is always in demand, especially for rare blood types.
                Every healthy person has the opportunity to be a hero by donating blood and contributing to a healthier world.
